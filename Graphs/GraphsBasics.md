## Types of Graphs

### 1. Directed Graph
Edges have direction.
Example: A → B

### 2. Undirected Graph
Edges are two-way.
Example: A — B

### 3. Weighted Graph
Edges have costs/weights.

### 4. Unweighted Graph
Edges have no weights.

### 5. Cyclic Graph
Contains cycles.

### 6. Acyclic Graph
No cycles (Example: DAG).
