# Graph Basics - DSA Notes

## What is a Graph?
A graph is a non-linear data structure made of:
- **Vertices (Nodes)**
- **Edges (Connections)**

Used in:
- Maps & navigation
- Social networks
- Network routing
- Scheduling problems

## Types of Graphs

### 1. Directed Graph
Edges have direction.
Example: A → B

### 2. Undirected Graph
Edges are two-way.
Example: A — B

### 3. Weighted Graph
Edges have costs/weights.

### 4. Unweighted Graph
Edges have no weights.

### 5. Cyclic Graph
Contains cycles.

### 6. Acyclic Graph
No cycles (Example: DAG).

## Graph Representations

### 1. Adjacency Matrix
2D array — good for dense graphs.

### 2. Adjacency List
Each node stores list of neighbors — best for sparse graphs.
